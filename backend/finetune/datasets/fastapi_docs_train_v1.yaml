notes: |
  Small starter set meant to validate the fine-tuning workflow end-to-end.
  For meaningful gains, generate/curate a larger train set and keep a separate eval set.
examples:
  - id: what_is_fastapi
    query: What is FastAPI?
    answer: |
      FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs using standard Python type hints.
      It is built on Starlette for the web layer and Pydantic for data validation/serialization.

  - id: quickstart_run_dev
    query: How do I run a FastAPI app in development with auto-reload?
    answer: |
      A common approach is to run Uvicorn with reload enabled, for example:
      `uvicorn main:app --reload`

  - id: path_vs_query
    query: What's the difference between path parameters and query parameters in FastAPI?
    answer: |
      Path parameters are part of the URL path and are required to match the path template (e.g. `/items/{item_id}`).
      Query parameters come after `?` in the URL and are typically optional (often expressed by giving a default value).

  - id: request_body_pydantic
    query: How do I declare a JSON request body using a Pydantic model?
    answer: |
      Define a class that inherits from `BaseModel`, then use it as a function parameter in your path operation.
      FastAPI will parse and validate the request JSON into that model.

  - id: response_model
    query: What does response_model do in FastAPI?
    answer: |
      `response_model` declares the schema of the response data.
      FastAPI uses it to validate and serialize the output and to document the response in the OpenAPI schema.

  - id: raise_httpexception
    query: How do you return an HTTP error response from a path operation?
    answer: |
      Raise `HTTPException` with an appropriate status code and detail, for example:
      `raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Not found")`.

  - id: dependencies_basics
    query: What is dependency injection in FastAPI?
    answer: |
      Dependencies are callables that FastAPI can execute to provide values to your path operations (and other dependencies).
      You declare them with `Depends(...)`, which enables reuse and shared logic (auth, DB sessions, etc.).

  - id: cors_middleware
    query: How do I enable CORS in FastAPI?
    answer: |
      Add `CORSMiddleware` to the app and configure allowed origins/methods/headers as needed.

  - id: background_tasks
    query: What is BackgroundTasks used for?
    answer: |
      `BackgroundTasks` lets you schedule functions to run after returning a response, useful for lightweight async work
      like sending emails or writing logs without blocking the request.

  - id: static_files
    query: How do I serve static files in FastAPI?
    answer: |
      Mount `StaticFiles` on a path, for example:
      `app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")`.

  - id: websocket
    query: Does FastAPI support WebSockets?
    answer: |
      Yes. FastAPI supports WebSocket endpoints, and you can define them with `@app.websocket(...)`.

  - id: testclient
    query: How do I test a FastAPI app?
    answer: |
      You can use `TestClient` to call your app in tests and make assertions on status codes and JSON responses.
